## TidyTuesday

[\#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/README.md)
is a project aimed at the R ecosystem where a new dataset is delivered
weekly. The project emerged as a collaborative idea from the R4DS Online
Learning Community and the [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz)
textbook, and connected through the **\#RStats** community, as an
exercise to exercise the understanding of how to manipulate and organize
data to make graphs with {[tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org)} tools
such as {[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org)},
{[tidyr](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org)},
{[dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org)}.
